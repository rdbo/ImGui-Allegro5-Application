# ImGUI Allegro5 Application

# How to compile on Linux

Make sure all the dependencies of the file requirements.txt are satisfied. Installing them through a package manager, such as APT might work.  
Give execute permission to the file "compile.sh" by running the command:  
```
$ chmod +x compile.sh
```
Run "compile.sh":  
```
$ ./compile.sh
```
The output file is called "imgui_allegro5_app". To test it, run:
```
$ ./imgui_allegro5_app
```
